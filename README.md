Training repository "JavaScript: Consuming and processing data from an API" by Alura Cursos Online.


This project was developed to see in practice how the use of an API works.
In this case, the API used performs the function of checking a database of addresses and returning exactly the address linked to the zip code that the user types when filling out the form, and with that, it seeks to standardize the data that is captured when filling out this form. For example: now all the names of streets, neighborhoods and cities will be standardized and written in the same way.
